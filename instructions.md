day 1: Jan.24 or 25

We're going to setup the project and:

1. figure out how to select a new random word each time we load the page and how to see that word in the console (ie, how to cheat)
2. Make a single text entry box on the web page
3. Attach an event listener that listens for keyboard actions so we can display letters on the page

When we finish, you can work on grasshopper.
